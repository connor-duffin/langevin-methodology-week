# sfmcmc: Statistical Finite elements via Markov Chain Monte Carlo

This package contains samplers for the statistical finite element method, as implemented for the Poisson equation, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. These samplers target both the prior measure, and, the posterior measure.

It is planned that further development will be done with this package, as we investigate additional samplers.

After installing the package, the tests can be run with `python3 -m pytest tests`.

Please let me know if there are any bugs (connor.p.duffin (@) gmail.com).
